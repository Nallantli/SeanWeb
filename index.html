			<h1>PAST <b>AUTHORS</b></h1>
			<p>The 1455 Center for Literary Arts hosts a wide variety of seminars and events to showcase writers from across the world - many of whom can be found listed below, along with a short biography and a selection of their works.
				<br><br>
			The books listed under the names of the authors below direct you to the <a href="https://www.winchesterbookgallery.com/">Winchester Book Gallery</a>, where you may purchase the works. It is the hope of 1455 that our organization can nurture the growth of the local literary community.

			<i>Hi Sean, I figured you might want to write something about the people listed below in an introductory section, don't mind what I've written here just tell me how you'd like it rewritten.</i>
